# Ether-bot
- a bot that helps you check transactions done on the etherium blockchain, can check the latest eth price and can be used to to check the amount of ether one has in their wallet

- Quite handy, don't you think?

- for the private token loaded from the .env file, it is the private token given to you from telegram

- Deployment: get a file named "Procfile" and in it write  "worker: python main.py", get a requirement.txt file and in it write all the python modules used, then deploy to heroku
